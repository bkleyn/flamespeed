    "#### Irreversible Elementary Reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical and physical underpinnings of this chemical kinetics library is to solve for the reaction rates of a system consisting of $N$ species undergoing $M$ **irreversible**, **elementary** reactions of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\\nu_{ij}^{\\prime}\\mathcal{S}_{i}} \\longrightarrow \n",
    "  \\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\\nu_{ij}^{\\prime\\prime}\\mathcal{S}_{i}}, \\qquad j = 1, \\ldots, M\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "An example system of reactions for which the reaction rates can be determined by this library is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ H_{2} + O_{2} \\longrightarrow H_{2}O + O$$\n",
    "$$ H_{2}O + O \\longrightarrow 2OH $$\n",
    "$$ OH + H_{2} \\longrightarrow 2H + OH $$\n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, the **reaction rate** of specie $i$ can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  f_{i} = \\sum_{j=1}^{M}{\\nu_{ij}\\omega_{j}}, \\qquad i = 1, \\ldots, N\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "where the **progress rate** for each reaction is denoted by:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "  \\omega_{j} = k_{j}\\prod_{i=1}^{N}{x_{i}^{\\nu_{ij}^{\\prime}}}, \\qquad j = 1, \\ldots, M\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to the table below for an overview of used symbols. Note that $k_{j}$ is the forward reaction rate coefficient, and is a direct input to a reaction's progress rate. Specifically, this library is capable of handling and calculating three different types of reaction rate coefficients:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ Constant: k_j = c $$\n",
    "$$ Arrhenius: k_j = Ae^{(-\\dfrac{E}{RT})}$$\n",
    "$$ Modified \\hspace{0.25em} Arrhenius: k_j = AT^{b}e^{(-\\dfrac{E}{RT})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The library assigns each elementary reaction its own reaction rate coefficient. When loading an XML-file with data, the rate coefficient type needs to be specified. In case of a Arrhenius reaction rate coefficient, additional values need to be provided for $A$, $E$, $R$, $T$. In case of Modified Arrhenius reaction rate coefficient, additional values need to be provided for $A$, $b$, $E$, $R$, $T$.\n",

    "#### Reversible Elementary Reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the above derivations hold for **irreversible** elementary reactions, oftentimes **reversible** elementary reactions occur in nature instead (i.e., the products can react and produce the reactants and so forth). Generally, a reversible reaction will have the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\\nu_{ij}^{\\prime}\\mathcal{S}_{i}}  \\rightleftharpoons \\sum_{i=1}^{N}{\\nu_{ij}^{\\prime\\prime}\\mathcal{S}_{i}} \\qquad j = 1, \\ldots, M$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\rightleftharpoons$ indicts that the foward and backward reactions occur. Note this sign is technically the only difference with the above derive reaction forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total progress rate is then given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\omega_{j} = k_{j}^{\\left(f\\right)}\\prod_{i=1}^{N}{x_{i}^{\\nu_{ij}^{\\prime}}} - k_{j}^{\\left(b\\right)}\\prod_{i=1}^{N}{x_{i}^{\\nu_{ij}^{\\prime\\prime}}}, \\qquad j = 1,\\ldots, M.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If, and only if, the reaction is elementary, the **backward reaction coefficient** can be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$k_{j}^{\\left(b\\right)} = \\frac{k_{j}^{\\left(f\\right)}}{k_{j}^{e}}, \\qquad j =1, \\ldots, M$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k_{j}^{e}$ is the **equilibrium coefficient** for reaction $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final expression for the equilibrium coefficient is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$k_{j}^{e} = \\left(\\frac{p_{0}}{RT}\\right)^{\\gamma_{j}}\\exp\\left(\\frac{\\Delta S_{j}}{R} - \\frac{\\Delta H_{j}}{RT}\\right), \\qquad j =1, \\ldots, M$$\n",

    "## New Feature\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Motivation and feature description\n",
    "\n",
    "The new features for the Flamespeed library adds flexibility by converting user inputs with relevant warnings if incomplete or non-standard input is provided. An array of validation checks are performed on the input data to ensure the input data is self-consistent, improving the robustness of the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flexibility**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Additional usage flexibility is allowed for in several areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unit conversion:\n",
    "\n",
    "         a. Parsed reaction coefficient data is converted to metric units before any \n",
    "           computations for a finite set of common conversions that might be required\n",
    "\n",
    "* Incomplete Reaction Rate Parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "         a. Calling Arrhenius yet providing factor b in the XML file \n",
    "            results in flamespeed applying Modified Arrhenius \n",
    "        \n",
    "* Three-Body Reactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "         a. Parser extended to import parameters for three-body reactions\n",
    "         b. Implemented hooks in code for further future development of three-body reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Robustness and consistency**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Additional robustness will be achieved following a two-pronged approach; namely checking user input consistency (i.e., in the form of XML files) as well as enforcing internal consistency throughout.\n",
    "\n",
    "* User Input:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        a. Parsed chemical reaction equations are checked for conservation of mass\n",
    "        b. Validation performed to ensure required data exists in thermo database for \n",
    "           input species\n",
    "\n",
    "* Self-consistent reaction data in XML file, by performing the following integrity checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "         a. XML file contains all the required tags and is self-consistent\n",
    "         b. Reaction type tags are consistent with reaction type implied by equations\n",
    "         c. Species in reaction equations correspond to the \"species array\" in XML file\n",
    "         d. Species in product/reactant arrays correspond to \"species array\" in XML file\n",
    "         \n",
    "The primary goal of the flamespeed chemical kinetics library is for users to use the package for real-life chemical kinetics computations. As such, providing potential users with additional measures to assure both user input consistency and internal library consistency is deemed highly relevant and practical. Added flexibility in terms of reaction rate specification and three-body reaction hooks only add to the relevance of this library to practicioners.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Implementation details\n",
    "\n",
    "Another module (parser.py) that contains most of the features described above, was added to the library. Given the scope of the additional features it made sense to create a separate module, rather than including this in the main chemkin module. Changes were also made to the main module (chemkin.py) to integrate the new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "An overview of the additional features added to each of the modules is included below. See Parser Module section above for a more detailed specification of the classes and methods included in the module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module descriptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "*parser.py*\n",
    "\n",
    "* Contains all of the methods to check / validate self-consistency of the input data\n",
    "* Includes methods to extract the list of species, reaction rate coefficient parameters and stoichiometric coefficients\n",
    "* Checks reactions for conservation of mass and performs unit conversions if required\n",
    "\n",
    "*chemkin.py*\n",
    "\n",
    "* Contains the main method to read reaction data from the XML file (read_XML)\n",
    "* Performing validation checks on the input file and converting units have been added as optional parameters to ensure consistency with other projects and previous versions of this project\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit Conversion**\n",
    "\n",
    "A central part to the proposed feature is the possibility to convert a random set of units inherited from an `xml` input file into a set of consistent SI-units. A few points are worth highlighting below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where do the units occur: \n",
    "* Arrhenius prefactor \"A\"\n",
    "    * Found in the `xml` input file\n",
    "* Activation energy \"E\"\n",
    "    * Found in the `xml` input file\n",
    "    \n",
    "What SI base units do conversions lead to:\n",
    "* Meter (and its derivatives such as $m^3$, $m^6$, etc.)\n",
    "* Joule\n",
    "* Mol\n",
    "* Seconds\n",
    "\n",
    "What units are accounted for?\n",
    "* A number of basic units are available as standard in the flamespeed package:\n",
    "    * Length: ft, yd, cm, mm, etc.\n",
    "    * Energy: cal, kcal, kJ, etc.\n",
    "    * Time: minutes, etc.\n",
    "* Users can expand the list of allowed units by simply expanding the `./data/units.csv` file with as many units as desired\n",
    "    * In `./data/units.csv` users can also easily change the base units (i.e., it need not necessarily be those specified above)\n",
    "    \n",
    "**Conservation of mass**\n",
    "\n",
    "The read_XML method that reads the reaction data from an XML file has an option to check conservation of mass for each of the reactions. In order to do this, the molecular weight of each specie inlcuded in the system is read from the `thermo` SQL database to compare the total mass of the reactants and products in each reaction. If conservation of mass is vioated for any reaction in the system an appropriate error message is displayed. This option can be turned off if there are valid species included in the reaction data, which is not included in the database."
